In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error can occur if the keyExtractor function doesn't return unique keys for each item.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering, performance issues, and difficulty debugging.  For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 2'}]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate IDs!
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

The `keyExtractor` uses the `id` field, which is not unique.  This violates a fundamental requirement of FlatList.  React Native might not always throw a clear error message, making it hard to pinpoint the issue.
